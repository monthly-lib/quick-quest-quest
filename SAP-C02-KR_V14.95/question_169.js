Answer: B,D,E Explanation: AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (AWS DRS) is a service that minimizes downtime and data loss with fast, reliable recovery of on-premises and cloud-based applications using affordable storage, minimal compute, and point-in-time recovery1. Users can set up AWS DRS on their source servers to initiate secure data replication to a staging area subnet in their AWS account, in the AWS Region they select. Users can then launch recovery instances on AWS within minutes, using the most up-to-date server state or a previous point in time. To configure a cloud backup of the application with AWS DRS, users need to create a VPC that has at least two public subnets, a virtual private gateway, and an internet gateway. A VPC is a logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where users can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that they define2. A public subnet is a subnet that has a route to an internet gateway3. A virtual private gateway is the VPN concentrator on the Amazon side of the Site-to-Site VPN connection4. An internet gateway is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows communication between instances in the VPC and the internet. Users need to create at least two public subnets for redundancy and high availability. Users need to create a virtual private gateway and attach it to the VPC to enable VPN connectivity between the on-premises network and the target AWS network. Users need to create an internet gateway and attach it to the VPC to enable internet access for the replication servers. To ensure that replication traffic does not travel through the public internet, users need to create an AWS Direct Connect connection and a Direct Connect gateway between the onpremises network and the target AWS network. AWS Direct Connect is a service that establishes a dedicated network connection from an on-premises network to one or more VPCs. A Direct Connect gateway is a globally available resource that allows users to connect multiple VPCs across different Regions to their on-premises networks using one or more Direct Connect connections. Users need to create an AWS Direct Connect connection between their on-premises network and an AWS Region. Users need to create a Direct Connect gateway and associate it with their VPC and their Direct Connect connection. To ensure that the application is not accessible from the internet, users need to select the option to use private IP addresses for data replication during configuration of the replication servers. This option configures the replication servers with private IP addresses only, without assigning any public IP addresses or Elastic IP addresses. This way, the replication servers can only communicate with other resources within the VPC or through VPN connections. Option A is incorrect because creating a VPC that has at least two private subnets, two NAT gateways, and a virtual private gateway is not necessary or cost-effective. A private subnet is a subnet that does not have a route to an internet gateway3. A NAT gateway is a highly available, managed Network Address Translation (NAT) service that enables instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS services, but prevents the internet from initiating connections with those instances. Users do not need to create private subnets or NAT gateways for this use case, as they can use public subnets with private IP addresses for data replication. Option C is incorrect because creating an AWS Site-to-Site VPN connection between the onpremises network and the target AWS network will not ensure that replication traffic does not travel through the public internet. A Site-to-Site VPN connection consists of two VPN tunnels between an on-premises customer gateway device and a virtual private gateway in your VPC4. The VPN tunnels are encrypted using IPSec protocols, but they still use public IP addresses for communication. Users need to use AWS Direct Connect instead of Site-to-Site VPN for this use case. Option F is incorrect because selecting the option to ensure that the Recovery instance's private IP address matches the source server's private IP address during configuration of the launch settings for the target servers will not ensure that the application is not accessible from the internet. This option configures the Recovery instance with an identical private IP address as its source server when launched in drills or recovery mode. However, this option does not prevent assigning public IP addresses or Elastic IP addresses to the Recovery instance. Users need to select the option to use private IP addresses for data replication instead.`;
