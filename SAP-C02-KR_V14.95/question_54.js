const question_54=`QUESTION NO: 54 회사에서 새로운 웹 기반 애플리케이션을 배포하고 있으며 Linux 애플리케이션 서버용 스토리지 솔루션이 필요합니다. 회사는 모든 인스턴스에 대한 애플리케이션 데이터 업데이트를 위한 단일 위치를 생성하려고 합니다. 활성 데이터 세트의 크기는 최대 100GB입니다. 솔루션 설계자는 매일 3시간 동안 최대 작업이 발생하고 총 225MiBps의 읽기 처리량이 필요하다고 결정했습니다. 솔루션 설계자는 재해 복구(DR)를 위해 다른 AWS 리전에서 사용할 수 있는 데이터 사본을 만드는 다중 AZ 솔루션을 설계해야 합니다. DR 사본의 RPO는 1시간 미만입니다. 이러한 요구 사항을 충족하는 솔루션은 무엇입니까? A. 새로운 Amazon Elastic File System(Amazon EFS) 다중 AZ 파일 시스템을 배포합니다. 프로비저닝된 처리량의 75MiBps에 대해 파일 시스템을 구성합니다. DR 지역의 파일 시스템에 대한 복제를 구현합니다. B. 새로운 Amazon FSx for Lustre 파일 시스템을 배포합니다. 파일 시스템에 대한 버스팅 처리량 모드를 구성합니다. AWS Backup을 사용하여 파일 시스템을 DR 리전에 백업합니다. C. 처리량이 225MiBps인 범용 SSD(gp3) Amazon Elastic Block Store(Amazon EBS) 볼륨을 배포합니다. EBS 볼륨에 대해 다중 연결을 활성화합니다. AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery를 사용하여 EBS 볼륨을 DR 리전에 복제합니다. D. 프로덕션 리전과 DR 리전 모두에 Amazon FSx for OpenZFS 파일 시스템을 배포합니다. 10분마다 프로덕션 파일 시스템에서 DR 파일 시스템으로 데이터를 복제하는 AWS DataSync 예약 작업을 생성합니다. Answer: A Explanation: The company should deploy a new Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) Multi-AZ file system. The company should configure the file system for 75 MiBps of provisioned throughput. The company should implement replication to a file system in the DR Region. This solution will meet the requirements because Amazon EFS is a serverless, fully elastic file storage service that lets you share file data without provisioning or managing storage capacity and performance. Amazon EFS is built to scale on demand to petabytes without disrupting applications, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files1. By deploying a new Amazon EFS Multi-AZ file system, the company can create a single location for updates to application data for all instances. A Multi-AZ file system replicates data across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) within a Region, providing high availability and durability2. By configuring the file system for 75 MiBps of provisioned throughput, the company can ensure that it meets the peak operations requirement of 225 MiBps of read throughput. Provisioned throughput is a feature that enables you to specify a level of throughput that the file system can drive independent of the file system's size or burst credit balance3. By implementing replication to a file system in the DR Region, the company can make a copy of the data available in another AWS Region for disaster recovery. Replication is a feature that enables you to replicate data from one EFS file system to another EFS file system across AWS Regions. The replication process has an RPO of less than 1 hour. The other options are not correct because: Deploying a new Amazon FSx for Lustre file system would not provide a single location for updates to application data for all instances. Amazon FSx for Lustre is a fully managed service that provides cost-effective, high-performance storage for compute workloads. However, it does not support concurrent write access from multiple instances. Using AWS Backup to back up the file system to the DR Region would not provide real-time replication of dat a. AWS Backup is a service that enables you to centralize and automate data protection across AWS services. However, it does not support continuous data replication or cross- Region disaster recovery. Deploying a General Purpose SSD (gp3) Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) volume with 225 MiBps of throughput would not provide a single location for updates to application data for all instances. Amazon EBS is a service that provides persistent block storage volumes for use with Amazon EC2 instances. However, it does not support concurrent access from multiple instances, unless Multi-Attach is enabled. Enabling Multi-Attach for the EBS volume would not provide Multi-AZ resilience or cross-Region replication. Multi-Attach is a feature that enables you to attach an EBS volume to multiple EC2 instances within the same Availability Zone. Using AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery to replicate the EBS volume to the DR Region would not provide real-time replication of data. AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (AWS DRS) is a service that enables you to orchestrate and automate disaster recovery workflows across AWS Regions. However, it does not support continuous data replication or sub-hour RPOs. Deploying an Amazon FSx for OpenZFS file system in both the production Region and the DR Region would not be as simple or cost-effective as using Amazon EFS. Amazon FSx for OpenZFS is a fully managed service that provides high-performance storage with strong data consistency and advanced data management features for Linux workloads. However, it requires more configuration and management than Amazon EFS, which is serverless and fully elastic. Creating an AWS DataSync scheduled task to replicate the data from the production file system to the DR file system every 10 minutes would not provide real-time replication of data. AWS DataSync is a service that enables you to transfer data between onpremises storage and AWS services, or between AWS services. However, it does not support continuous data replication or sub-minute RPOs.
